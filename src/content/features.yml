  - title: Automatic mesh generation
    description: >
      Starting from a segmented image of the compartments in the model,
      the boundaries are automatically identified and simplified,
      and from them a triangular mesh approximation to the geometry is constructed.
      The number of points used in the boundary lines and the triangle size can be adjusted by the user.

  - title: Python interface
    description: >
      The Python interface, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sme">sme</a>, allows scripted editing and simulation of a model.
      Simulation results are returned as numpy arrays.
      Additional plotting and parameter fitting functionality is provided by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sme-contrib">sme-contrib</a>.
