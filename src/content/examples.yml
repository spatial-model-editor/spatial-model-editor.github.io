    description: >
      The <a href="https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~gros/StudentProjects/Projects_2020/projekt_schulz_kaefer/">Gray-Scott</a> model
      is a simple spatial model with two species and two parameters,
      which forms spatial patterns that eventually reach a steady state distribution.
      It is one of the built in example models in Spatial Model Editor.
      Here the time evolution of the concentration of a species is shown for three values of the parameter f.
